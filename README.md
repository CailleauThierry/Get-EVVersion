# Get-EVVersion
-  This personal project aims at extracting technical support information from EVault's logs
-  Get-EVVersion.exe.config has not changed since Get-EVVersion04_01.ps1 but .exe.config and .exe as generated by PowerGUI are not used anymore anyway. Instead I use Windows Shortcut as a wrapper to invoke my script utilities.
